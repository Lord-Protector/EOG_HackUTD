Ok so this is just a proof of concept. To run it:

1. Install node.js
2. In the terminal, navigate to the file and run "node serve.js" ommiting quotes
3. Run the python script (which is the same as the pyplot version except it saves the pie chart instead of displaying it and ignores the bar graph for now)
4. In a web browser, go to localhost:8080

This is extremely janky; a lot of the time it counts characters in the message funny and jumbles the amount and the graph, but most of the time it updates both the graph and number. It also doesn't use any css but that's the easy part.
